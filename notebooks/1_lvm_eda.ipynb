Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. They believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. Using your friends initial research, you'll delve into the Netflix data to see if you can determine whether movie lengths are actually getting shorter and explain some of the contributing factors, if any."

Using a for loop and `if/elif` statements, iterate through the rows of `netflix_movies` and assign colors of your choice to four genre groups (\"`Children`\", \"`Documentaries`\", \"`Stand-Up`\", and \"`Other`\" for everything else). Save the results in a colors list. Initialize a figure object called fig and create a scatter plot for movie duration by release year using the colors list to color the points and using the labels \"`Release year`\" for the x-axis, \"`Duration (min)`\" for the y-axis, and the title \"`Movie Duration by Year of Release`\".\n",
